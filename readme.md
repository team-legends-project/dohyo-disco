## What is it?

A Phaser 3 single and two player Sumo inspired game. Either single player, or two player hot seating, choose your fighter. Your character will have a keyboard button flash above their head. Press the right key quicker than your opponent to force them out of the ring. Best of three rounds to win the match.

## Where is it?

Dohyo Disco is hosted using Netlify and can be found [here](https://dohyo-disco.netlify.app/)

## How its made

Using JavaScript along with the Phaser library the game is created using Classes for each scene.

To run the game a web server needs to be running to support the game's update loop. This repo leverages a Vite config to run locally and is hosted on netlify to run in browser.
